Welcome to modelparameters's documentation!
===========================================

Modelparameters is a lightweight library to declare nested parameters
in Python, and can be used as a module for providing parameter
structure for physical models. It is mainly developed as a tool for
`gotran <https://bitbucket.org/finsberg/gotran>`_, but certainly not
limited to that.
